More info can be also be found in the [Gradle Play Publisher](https://github.com/Triple-T/gradle-play-publisher/blob/master/README.md).

To get the Service Account json key follow this [Google Play Developer API](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started)


LIMITATION
-----
The first APK or App Bundle needs to be uploaded via the Google Play Console because registering the app with the Play Store cannot be done using the Play Developer API. For all subsequent uploads and changes, GPP may be used.
