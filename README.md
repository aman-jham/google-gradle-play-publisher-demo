Gradle Play Publisher Demo 
-----
This is very useful plugin for building, uploading, and then promoting your App Bundle or APK to publishing app listings and other metadata in google play console.



LIMITATION
-----
The first APK or App Bundle needs to be uploaded via the Google Play Console because registering the app with the Play Store cannot be done using the Play Developer API. For all subsequent uploads and changes, GPP may be used.
